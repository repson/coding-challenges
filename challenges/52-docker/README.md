Coding Challenge #52 - Docker

This challenge is to build your own version of Docker.

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. It does that by packaging software into container images. These container images include everything needed to run the software - libraries, system tools, configuration and application.

There are two key parts of the Docker ecosystem that we’re going to look at in this Coding Challenge, Docker Hub and the Docker Engine.

Docker Hub us a container registry. It allows developers to find use and share container images. Docker Engine, which provides a container runtime that can run these container images ensuring that the containerised software runs the same wherever it is deployed.

Happy Birthday Coding Challenges!

To celebrate Coding Challenges being one year old, I’m offering 20% off my courses for the next few days. Use the code: ONEYEAR.

The Challenge - Building Your Own Docker

In this Coding Challenge we’re going to build an application to pull a container image from Docker Hub, unpack and run it in our own container runtime.

This Coding Challenge is a long one, unfortunately too long to fit within the size limit that Substack supports for newsletters. So if you’re interested in giving it a go please visit the build your own Docker page on the Coding Challenges website.

Share Your Solutions!

If you think your solution is an example of the developers can learn from please share it, put it on GitHub, GitLab or elsewhere. Then let me know via Twitter or LinkedIn or just post about it there and tag me.

Request for Feedback

I’m writing these challenges to help you develop your skills as a software engineer based on how I’ve approached my own personal learning and development. What works for me, might not be the best way for you - so if you have suggestions for how I can make these challenges more useful to you and others, please get in touch and let me know. All feedback greatly appreciated.

You can reach me on Twitter, LinkedIn or through SubStack

Thanks and happy coding!
