This challenge is to build your own QR code generator.

A QR code (short for quick-response code) is a sort of two dimensional barcode. They were invented in 1994 by the Japanese company Denso Wave to label car parts. Like barcodes they are a machine readable optical image that can contain information.

Unfortunately this challenge is rather wordy, so itâ€™s exceeded the length of a substack post! You can find the full challenge on the website as Build Your Own QR Code Generator.
