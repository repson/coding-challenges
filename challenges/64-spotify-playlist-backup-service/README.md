Hi this is John with this week‚Äôs Coding Challenge.

üôè Thank you for being one of the 57,153 software developers who have subscribed, I‚Äôm honoured to have you as a reader. üéâ

If there is a Coding Challenge you‚Äôd like to see, please let me know by replying to this emailüìß

The Challenge - Building A Spotify Playlist Backup Tool

This challenge is to build your own Spotify backup tool. It‚Äôs inspired by my kids who wanted to ensure they can backup and move their playlists that they‚Äôve spent ages curating. They‚Äôre not the only people who had this problem and we‚Äôre not the first to solve it.

The challenge is perfect for frontend developers. It focuses on using Spotify‚Äôs API to interact with the Spotify service to build a client that can download a user‚Äôs playlist.

If you‚Äôre not a frontend dev and don‚Äôt fancy learning some frontend, you can still use the Spotify‚Äôs API from your favourite stack.

So whilst, this challenge is aimed at all those who have been asked for a more frontend focused challenge, you can still build this as a command line application if you prefer.

Step Zero

Please set up your IDE / editor and programming language of choice.

After that navigate to Spotify‚Äôs website and create an account if you don‚Äôt already have one. Once you‚Äôve done that head over to the Developer Website.

You can use the API without registering an app, but we‚Äôre going to access some personal data (our profile and some public playlists) so we‚Äôll need to register an application.

Click on the Create app button or link to do so:

Enter some sensible values for the app (I‚Äôve reused the app from the build your own Spotify Client Coding Challenge:

Then click on the button to create it!

Step 1

In this step your goal is to authenticate with the Spotify API. To backup public playlists you don‚Äôt need to be logged in as the user, so you can use the client id and secret you‚Äôve created in step 0. Don‚Äôt forget to ensure they are stored securely.

Spotify offer several options for authentication. You‚Äôll find details of how to do this on in their documentation here.

Be sure to test your authentication code works - perhaps use the supplied credentials to try one of the API calls.

Step 2

In this step your goal is to be able to download a public playlist using the Spotify Web API‚Äôs playlist functionality. For this coding challenge I suggest you get the artist, album, track name. Feel free to add anything else you think would be useful.

Step 3

In this step your goal is to create a UI that will get the playlist id from the user and then use that to fetch the playlist from Spotify. Something like this:

Step 4

In this step your goal is to export / download the public playlist as a CSV (or zipped CSV if it‚Äôs large).

Step 5

In this step your goal is to allow a Spotify user to log in as themselves and back up all of their playlists.

They should then be able to download / export all their playlists, not just the public ones.

Going Further

You could take this further by:

    Extending it to support exporting playlists from other music services.

    Providing a tool to upload / create the same playlist in Spotify and/or another music service, making it easy to move between them.

2 Other Ways I Can Help You:

    I write another FREE newsletter Developing Skills that helps you level up the other skills you need to be a great software developer.

    I have some courses available:

        Build Your Own Redis Server (Python Edition) which guides you through solving the Redis Coding Challenge in Python.

        Build Your Own Shell (Go Edition) which guides you through solving the Shell Coding Challenge in Go.

Share Your Solutions!

If you think your solution is an example other developers can learn from please share it, put it on GitHub, GitLab or elsewhere. Then let me know via Twitter or LinkedIn or just post about it there and tag me.

Request for Feedback

I‚Äôm writing these challenges to help you develop your skills as a software engineer based on how I‚Äôve approached my own personal learning and development. What works for me, might not be the best way for you - so if you have suggestions for how I can make these challenges more useful to you and others, please get in touch and let me know. All feedback greatly appreciated.

You can reach me on Twitter, LinkedIn or through SubStack

Thanks and happy coding!
